# LoRaRC
Remote control using an ESP32 and a LoRa module.

Disclaimer! I am a complete beginner and this code might be really not optimized(or whatever the word for it is).

# Important
I discourage anyone doing this project to use an Arduino NANO for the reciever as it is not as powerful as the rest.
I used the ESP32 as the reciever and an Arduino NANO as the transmitter and it still caused issues as it kept restarting sometimes(That could be an error in the code but IDK).
